Here are all the secrets:

Passcode Page:
  You can get the passcode one of three ways.
  1. all the codes are floating in the background and the current code is the darkest opacity
  2. the current code is italicized in the helper popup messages
  3. if you open up the inspector on the html page, the code is printed to console
  All together, they spell out a sentence. It just loops through the sentence by 3's to get the passcodes.

Discussion Tree:
  There are three outcomes to the discussion.
    1. you piss them off and get sent back to the passcode
    2. you intrigue them and they send you to the puzzle
    3. you impress them and they let you to the reward
  The easiest ways to get to the reward are either to be genuinely curious or be an aloof asshole. They think the latter is hilarious.
  If you tap on the message bubble, you can skip through the typing effect.

Puzzle Page:
  Obviously, the puzzle is hangman.
  The phrases are also printed to console, but that's usually more trouble than it's worth. Playing the game is faster.
  Worst case scenario, you get sent back to the passcode.

Chat Page:
  The secret passcode to get here is italicized in a helper popup when you get back from the reward page.
  It's their name, so if you know that, you don't even have to wait lol.
  And it's also printed to console, so if you aren't familiar with my OCs, you can look there.

And I think that's all the secrets? If you get stuck at any point and want to know why, you can always dm me.
And if you notice any bugs, please dm me so I can fix them. Knowing the specific circumstances around the bug is very helpful.
But yeah, I think that's all I got.
